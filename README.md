## Plans 

### Amazon API
+ Library: Official amazon api python wrapper. Docs: https://python-amazon-product-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
+ Identifying attributes: depends greatly on product type. Will need to work through the various desired categories
+ Will need to figure out rate limit issues here
+ XML responses make this suck, but I'll figure it out
### Walmart API
+ Next up
